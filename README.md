Soundcheck aims to provide speech assistance to autistic individuals by providing haptic feedback to atypical volume

This is a WIP Android application built on the work of Boyd et al. (2016) and Edgerton and Wine (2017) that seeks to provide conversational assistance to those with autism spectrum disorder, with application considerations for general speech therapy.

> "Prosody includes the rhythm and sounds in speech, and refers to the acoustic way words are spoken to convey meaning through changes in pitch, volume, and rate of speech.
> 
> Prosody has been shown to convey 70%-90% of the meaning of an utterance.
> 
> Atypical prosody is one of the most noticeable characteristics of autism, making speakers inadvertently sound angry, bored, or tired. It is also one of the most difficult social skills to change over a lifetime, often requiring intensive and extensive intervention.
>
> Atypical prosody leads to some individuals with autism to struggle to develop peer relationships, recognize emotions, and generally develop social skills for interactive communication."

- Boyd et al. (2016)

Soundcheck is based on SayWAT (a Google Glasses application) and Voice Meter Pro (an Android application).

It differs from the former by relying on existing commonplace hardware (earbuds, phones) and using haptic feedback rather than visual feedback.

It differs from the latter by focusing on passive monitoring, designed to be used to augument natural conversations rather than as a focus.
